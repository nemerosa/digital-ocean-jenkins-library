Digital Ocean Jenkins Library
=============================

[Jenkins pipeline library](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/) for using [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

It provides some tasks to interact with Digital Ocean services like Kubernetes clusters, load balancers, etc.

> It's a very early version. While provided steps *do* work, only very few features are covered.

## Steps
